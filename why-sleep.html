<h1>Why Sleep?</h1>
<p>When you sleep, you go through the sleep cycle, also know as the REM sleep.Your body starts to repair itself, fixing damaged bones or muscles. As well, your immune system strengthens up again. 
This is why it is recommended to us that we sleep and rest while we are sick. Not only does it benefit your physical health, but it also helps with the brain. 
The parts of the brain related with education are stimulated, helping you learn and remember things. Sleep also improves your mental health, improving mood and energy. 
Overall, sleep is one of the best ways to recover mentally and physically.
