<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>It starts out with a simple print statement. Then we access a .txt file that contains all of the puzzles and their respective categories. 
        To get the various puzzles used for our game, we found a website with wheel of fortune words and put it into a .txt file. 
        We organized the file into a dictionary where the categories are the keys and the words are the values. 
        We randomly select a category using the random function, then select a word from the category. 
        It's the same process for both regular rounds and the bonus round. 
        The word is then turned into question marks by multiplying the question mark by the length of the word. 
        We use the input function to ask and recieve the answers. 
        The input function then gets run through the check function to see if the letter/word is there. 
        The check function returns boolean values that determines what text is printed and how the points are altered. 
        If it returns true, you get a random number of points by using the wheel function, otherwise, it deducts points. 
        The points are saved between rounds by being added to a list, then it gets called on later. 
        For the bonus round, the check function checks r, s, t, l, n, and e and returns the result. 
        You get asked to input three consonants and a vowel and those also get checked. 
        If you get the bonus round right, it calls on the turtle function and also .bgpic. 
        .bg pic generates the wheel picture in the turtle screen while the turtle moves forward a random number. 
        Lastly, the random function picks a number from a list of 24 values and that number is the amount of points you get.
