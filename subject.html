<h2>How to Sleep</h2>
<p>You should relax and lay down on something very comfortable, preferably a mattress but anything works. To have a better sleep, you can drink some warm water or bath beforehand.
Also, don't do anything rigorous or anything involving electronics right before going to bed. Don't nap close to bedtime.

<h2>Why Sleep?</h2>
<p>When you sleep, you go through the sleep cycle, also know as the REM sleep.Your body starts to repair itself, fixing damaged bones or muscles. As well, your immune system strengthens up again.
Not only does it benefit your physical health, but it also helps with the brain. The parts of the brain related with education are stimulated, helping you learn and remember things. Sleep 
also improves your mental health, improving mood and energy. <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/sleep-deprivation-and-deficiency">sleep website</a></p>
