<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>Before you run the program, it is important to learn how the game works.
	You start out with 1000 points and you get points guessing a letter correctly then spinning the wheel. 
	The total amount of points you get is what you got the wheel times the number of letters guessed. If you manage to guess the entire word, you get three thousand additional points. 
	If you guess a letter wrong, 100 points is deducted. If you guess the word wrong, 500 points are deducted.
	If your points go below zero, you go bankrupt and the game ends.
	Now that you know how points work, let's run the program!
	When you run it, text appears.
	The text states the category of the word that you have to guess and also a bunch of question marks under it.
	You will also be asked to enter a consonant or the entire word. 
	Consonants are free, but if you enter a vowel, you will be asked if you want to buy it which costs 100 points. 
	If you manage to fill out both puzzles and have the required 10000 points, you move on to the final round. 
	In the final round, you will spin the wheel, the letters r, s, t, l, n, e will all be filled in and you will have three tries. 
Then, you have to choose three other consonants and one more vowel to try to fill out the puzzle the best you can. 
Next, you have to guess the correct word within the three tries. 
If you guess it correctly, then you will be awarded with the points you got from the wheel, if not, you donâ€™t get any points.
